    "# NLP-Various Implementations | Text Classification using TF-IDF Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:** In this part of the project, I implemented a machine learning model that classifies text using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms. The TfidfVectorizer function transforms text into feature vectors, and the train_classifier() function trains the classifier. The predict() function outputs predicted labels, whereas the run_model() function returns accuracy, dimensionality, time cost, and misclassification data for later use. The analyze_results() function outputs the most common misclassification pair and a random text with corresponding true and predicted labels for each model. The code also provides a way to compare the performance of Naive Bayes and SVM using various parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Import all the necessary modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Briefly:** `csv` library provides functionality for working with Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, `time` provides functions for working with time-related tasks, `random` provides tools for generating random numbers, `defaultdict` provides a way to create a dictionary with default values for nonexistent keys, `PrettyTable` provides a way to display data in a table format, `TfidfVectorizer` is a function from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` that transforms text into feature vectors, `MultinomialNB` and `LinearSVC` are machine learning algorithms from `sklearn.naive_bayes` and `sklearn.svm respectively`, used for text classification."
