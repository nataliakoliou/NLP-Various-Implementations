    "# NLP-Various Implementations | Word Embeddings Similarities & Analogies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:** In this part of the project, I implemented an algorithm that identifies similarities between words and predicts missing words in analogies, using the pre-trained word embeddings Word2vec and GloVe. For this purpose, I defined a function that finds the n most similar words for some user-defined input list of words, along with their scores. I also included a function that shows the common words between the two models for each word in that input list. Finally, the code calls the implemented functions with different input parameters to retrieve similar and common words for various words and analogies.\n",
